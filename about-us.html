            <h2>🔥 The Story of WoBBoB</h2>
            <p>
                From the streets of South West and Wiltshire to the forefront of Drum & Bass and AI development, WoBBoB’s journey is one of grit, self-belief, and triumph against the odds. 
                From a life filled with struggle to a career filled with groundbreaking beats and AI evolution, this is the story of turning adversity into greatness.
            </p>

            <h2>🎭 Early Battles & Overcoming Struggles</h2>
            <p>
                Life wasn’t easy. WoBBoB faced real struggles—mental health battles, addiction, crime, and the weight of past trauma. ADHD was always there in the background, 
                fueling both chaos and creativity. But instead of letting it drag him down, he flipped the script, using every setback as a stepping stone to something bigger.
            </p>

            <h2>🔨 From Builder to Beatmaker</h2>
            <p>
                Before the decks and drum machines, there was the building site. A solid foundation in discipline and hard work. But the real calling? Music. 
                Nights spent perfecting basslines, days spent turning raw emotion into sound. The transition from brick and mortar to beats and rhythm was inevitable.
            </p>

            <h2>🎶 Drum & Bass Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                The sound of WoBBoB is raw, real, and unforgettable. Each track is a piece of his story—basslines that hit hard, melodies that tell the journey. 
                Releases that shake the underground. From jungle rollers to tear-out anthems, the mission has always been the same: to bring the energy.
            </p>
