            <h2>🔥 The Story of WoBBoB</h2>
            <p>
                From the streets of South West and Wiltshire to the forefront of Drum & Bass and AI development, 
                WoBBoB's journey is one of grit, self-belief, and triumph against the odds. A story filled with struggle and redemption, 
                proving that determination can turn the darkest chapters into a light that shines brightly for others to follow.
            </p>

            <h2>🎭 Early Battles & Overcoming Struggles</h2>
            <p>
                Life was far from straightforward for WoBBoB. He faced significant challenges, including battles with addiction, 
                brushes with crime, and deep-rooted traumas from his past. These experiences, compounded by undiagnosed mental health struggles—apparent ADHD among them—often felt overwhelming. 
                Yet, rather than letting these struggles define him, he used them as fuel to build his future.
            </p>

            <h2>🔨 From Builder to Beatmaker</h2>
            <p>
                Starting as a builder, WoBBoB developed discipline and work ethic, but his real passion lay in music. 
                Teaching himself the art of Drum & Bass production, he immersed himself in underground sounds, 
                refining his unique style that quickly gained traction in the DnB scene.
            </p>

            <h2>🎶 Drum & Bass Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                WoBBoB’s music is a raw reflection of his life—intense, authentic, and deeply moving.  
                Tracks like <strong>“Wide Asleep”</strong> and <strong>“Quantum Bass”</strong> are more than songs; they are experiences,  
                capturing themes of struggle and triumph through powerful basslines and intricate beats.
