  <h1>Who is WoBBoB?</h1>
  
  <p>WoBBoB is a name forged in struggle and sharpened by survival. A father of two, a builder by trade, and a creator by necessity—he’s lived lives most couldn’t imagine. From navigating the streets of the South West and Wiltshire, to holding his own in and around the capital, life threw everything it could at him. Addiction, crime, poverty, mental health battles—he’s faced them all. And still, he rose.</p>
  
  <p>Every step forward came with a cost. WoBBoB didn’t just build his skills—he had to build *himself*. While learning to protect and defend his own, he became a figure for his children and a blueprint for resilience. There were no shortcuts. this time hed made the last F£&K UP. Just grit, growth, and the will to never back down.</p>
  
  <p>Entirely self-taught in music production and future-focused tech, WoBBoB now stands at the forefront of what’s next—fusing raw experience with digital innovation. He’s not an AI developer in the traditional sense—but his vision stretches deep into the future of computing, automation, and intelligent tools that serve real people, not just corporations.</p>
  
  <p>His Drum & Bass tracks—like <strong>Wide Asleep</strong> and <strong>Quantum Bass</strong>—aren’t just music. They’re his life, transformed into basslines and beats. Each one tells a story of survival, reflection, and forward motion.</p>
  
  <p>Now, WoBBoB is building two major projects from the ground up: the <strong>Trade 'A' Them Bot</strong>—a powerful financial automation system—and <strong>BoBBoT</strong>, a hybrid chatbot that blends function with raw personality. These aren’t just tech experiments. They’re tools made by someone who knows what it means to need an edge.</p>
  
  <p>Through it all, WoBBoB remains rooted—raising his children, shaping his future, and proving that no matter how dark the start, the story can still blaze with light.</p>
  
  <p>This is WoBBoB. Builder. Fighter. Father. Visionary. And he's just getting started.</p>
